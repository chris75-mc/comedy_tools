*This project is still in construction and will be updated frequently*
# Overview
Standup comedians use to record their materials when performing on stage so they can listen to it after the show to analyse their performances.\
*Was it funny ? Do people laughed at this joke ? Have I been better than the last session ?
Why this joke has lost in power, knowing that it used to be more impactful few weeks ago ? What did I change to get to this result?* \
Standup comedians ask constantly themselves those kind of questions. This is part of the learning process: getting feedback from the crowd and iterating on it to end with the best version of a joke, the one that get the *"best laugh"*.

This project aims to help comedians with their analysis and bring them a rational appreciation of their performance. Of course this application should not  be considered as a judge of the artistic quality of a performance but more as a tool that reveals just one aspect of a standup performance which is how effecient it is ?

# Plan
